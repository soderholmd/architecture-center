# Deploy Azure landing zones

This article discusses the options available to you to deploy platform and application landing zones. Platform landing zones provide centralized services used by workloads. Application landing zones are environments deployed for the workloads themselves.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about platform versus application landing zones definitions, see [What is an Azure landing zone?](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#platform-vs-application-landing-zones) in the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure documentation.

This article covers common roles and responsibilities for differing cloud operating models. It also lists deployment options for platform and application landing zones.

## Cloud operating model roles and responsibilities

The Cloud Adoption Framework describes four [common cloud operating models](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model/compare). [Azure identity and access for landing zones](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/identity-access-landing-zones#rbac-recommendations) recommends five role definitions (Roles) to consider if your organization's cloud operating model requires customized role-based access control. If your organization has more decentralized operations, the Azure [built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions-list) might be sufficient.

The following table outlines the key roles for each of the cloud operating models.

| Role | Decentralized operations | Centralized operations | Enterprise operations | Distributed operations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure platform owner (such as the built-in Owner role) | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Central cloud strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-strategy) | [Enterprise architect](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-strategy) in [Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) | Based on portfolio analysis. See [Business alignment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/considerations/business-alignment) and [Business commitments](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/considerations/commitment). |
| Network management (NetOps) | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Central IT](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) | [Central Networking](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) in [CCoE](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) | [Central Networking for each distributed team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) + [CCoE](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence). |
| Security operations (SecOps) | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Security operations center (SOC)](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-operations-center) | [CCoE](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) + [SOC](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-operations-center) | Mixed. See [Define a security strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-security-strategy). |
| Subscription owner | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Central IT](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) | [Central IT](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) + [Application Owners](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) | [CCoE](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) + [Application Owners](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it). |
| Application owners (DevOps, AppOps) | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Workload team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-adoption) | [Central IT](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) + [Application Owners](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) | [CCoE](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) + [Application Owners](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it). |

## Platform

The following options provide an opinionated approach to deploy and operate the [Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone#azure-landing-zone-conceptual-architecture) as detailed in the Cloud Adoption Framework. Depending upon customizations, the resulting architecture might not be the same for all the options listed here. The differences between the options are how you deploy the architecture. They use differing technologies, take different approaches, and are customized differently.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have reviewed and completed the [prerequisites](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale/wiki/Deploying-ALZ-Pre-requisites) before deploying Azure Landing Zones.

| Deployment option | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [Azure landing zone Portal accelerator](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/#azure-landing-zone-accelerator) | An Azure portal-based deployment provides a full implementation of the conceptual architecture, along with opinionated configurations for key components, such as management groups and policies. |
| [Azure landing zone Terraform accelerator](terraform/landing-zone-terraform.md) | This accelerator provides an orchestrator module and also allows you to deploy each capability individually or in part. |
| [Azure landing zone Bicep accelerator](bicep/landing-zone-bicep.md) | A modular accelerator where each module encapsulates a core capability of the [Azure landing zone conceptual architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone#azure-landing-zone-conceptual-architecture). While the modules can be deployed individually, the design proposes the use of orchestrator modules to encapsulate the complexity of deploying different topologies with the modules. |

### Variants

| Deployment option | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [Sovereign landing zone](/industry/sovereignty/slz-overview) | The sovereign landing zone (SLZ) is a variant of the enterprise scale Azure landing zone intended for organizations that need advanced sovereign controls. |

### Operate Azure landing zones

After you deploy the landing zone, you need to operate and maintain it. For more information, see the guidance on how to [Keep your Azure landing zone up to date](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date).

[Azure Governance Visualizer](https://aka.ms/alz/azgovviz) is intended to help you get a holistic overview on your technical Azure governance implementation by connecting the dots and providing sophisticated reports.

### Alternative platform deployment for policies with Enterprise Policy as Code (EPAC)

[Enterprise Policy as Code (EPAC)](https://aka.ms/epac) is an alternative method to deploy, manage, and operate Azure Policy in your environment. You can use EPAC instead of the preceding [platform options](#platform) to manage the policies in an Azure landing zones environment. For more information on the integration approach, see [Integrate EPAC with Azure landing zones](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/integrating-with-alz/).

EPAC is best suited for more advanced and mature DevOps and infrastructure-as-code customers. However, customers of any size can use EPAC if they want to after they assess it. To ensure that you're aligned, see [Who should use EPAC?](https://azure.github.io/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code#who-should-use-epac) first.

>[!NOTE]
> Evaluate and consider both options carefully. Potentially run through an MVP or proof of concept before you decide on what to use in the long term.

## Subscription vending

After the platform landing zone is in place, the next step is to create and operationalize application landing zones for workload owners. Subscription democratization is a [design principle](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-principles) of Azure landing zones that uses subscriptions as units of management and scale. This approach accelerates application migrations and new application development.

[Subscription vending](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/subscription-vending) standardizes the process you use to request, deploy, and govern subscriptions. It enables application teams to deploy their workloads faster. To get started, see [Subscription vending implementation guidance](/azure/architecture/landing-zones/subscription-vending). Then review the following infrastructure-as-code modules. They provide flexibility to fit your implementation needs.

| Deployment option | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [Bicep subscription vending](https://github.com/Azure/bicep-registry-modules/tree/main/avm/ptn/lz/sub-vending) | The subscription vending Bicep module is designed to accelerate deployment of the individual landing zones (also known as subscriptions) within a Microsoft Entra tenant on Enterprise Agreement (EA), Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), and Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA) billing accounts. |
| [Terraform subscription vending](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/lz-vending/azurerm/latest) | The subscription vending Terraform module is designed to accelerate deployment of the individual landing zones (also known as subscriptions) within a Microsoft Entra tenant on EA, MCA, and MPA billing accounts |

## Application

Application landing zones are one or more subscriptions that are deployed as environments for workloads or applications. These workloads can take advantage of services deployed in platform landing zones. The application landing zones can be centrally managed applications, decentralized workloads, or technology platforms such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that host applications.

You can use the following options to deploy and manage applications or workloads in an application landing zone.
